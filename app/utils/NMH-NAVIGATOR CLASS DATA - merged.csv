This course will introduce you to a literary approach to the Bible, concentrating on careful readings of selections from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Although it is impossible to read and discuss the Bible without reference to religion, the purpose of this course is to study the Bible not as a sacred text but as a complex literary work. As such, you will grapple with the content and the literary function of the biblical texts using the same techniques used to analyze any other complex literary work. What choices in form, style, and content shape the text, and what are the effects of those choices? How do structures, patterns, and the artful use of language and literary devices work to create meaning? Close, careful reading and discussion are central to this course, so be ready to read and engage actively –– and to do so with an attitude of curiosity, openness, and appreciation of multiple interpretive perspectives. Written work will include informal in-class exercises, short weekly responses, and longer, focused analytical essays.",Option to earn advanced (500-level) credit.,"Prerequisite: ENG 311, ENG 311LM, or equivalent."

ENG463.1,English Seminar: Coming of Age: Reading the Bildungsroman,Fall,Bev 118,"Open to juniors, seniors, and PGs.
This course explores the transition from youth to adulthood and its representation in literature. The period of time between adolescence and adulthood is often regarded as the most influential period in a person’s development. In literature, the bildungsroman, or coming-of-age novel, explores this transition, tracing the movement from the innocence of childhood to the knowledge and awareness of maturity. In this class, you will read books that investigate what it means to grow up, leave home, seek adventure, weather disappointments, and contend with one’s origins –– and what it means to grapple with change itself. How is identity shaped by the events of adolescence? What is involved in the transformation from adolescence into adulthood? How is the transition to adulthood imagined across time periods, literary genres, and differing points of view? How does reading literature shape and provide insight into our own identities? You will wrestle with these questions through class discussion and in a combination of analytical, personal, and creative writing pieces. Readings may include “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” by Ocean Vuong; “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” by James Joyce; “We the Animals,” by Justin Torres; “Nervous Conditions,” by Tsitsi Dangarembga; “Never Let Me Go,” by Kazuo Ishiguro; “The Secret History,” by Donna Tartt; and “Invisible Man,” by Ralph Ellison.",Option to earn advanced (500-level) credit.,"Prerequisite: ENG 311, ENG 311LM, or equivalent."
ENG470.1,English Seminar: Borderlands,Fall,Bev 233,"Open to juniors, seniors, and PGs.
I stood at the border; I stood at the edge and claimed it as central. I claimed it as central, and let the rest of the world move over to where I was.
— Toni Morrison
Borders — the imaginary lines that separate one nation from another, one community from another, us from them — have a profound impact on the lives and experiences of those who live within them as well as those who cross them. Ideas about borders play a complex role in our current understandings of race, class, gender, and citizenship. In this course you will read literature that explores borders and border-crossings — geographic, social, and perceptual; some literal, some psychological, some metaphorical — in order to consider what it means to live life “on the border.” Themes include migration, xenophobia, indigeneity, and concepts of home, foreignness, otherness, and belonging. How are borders constructed, and how are they transgressed? What makes a border appear threatening or inviting, liberatory or oppressive? How do personal and social identities play a role in who gets to cross which borders, and how safely? What does it mean to be shaped and informed by multiple places, homes, languages, or senses of self? What terrain — physically, culturally, emotionally — do writers inhabit when they write about borders? In this course, you will explore the ways that reading, writing, and thinking about borders, whether literal or metaphorical ones, complicate the way we understand identity, community, belonging, and citizenship. Like the literature you read, the writing you do in this course will dwell in the borderlands. By composing in forms that blend critical reading, narrative, personal reflection, and multimedia, you will think and write about others’ border crossings as well as your own.",Option to earn advanced (500-level) credit.,"Prerequisite: ENG 311, ENG 311LM, or equivalent."
ENG471.1,English Seminar: Comic Studies and Theory,Spring,,"Open to juniors, seniors, and PGs.
The graphic novel has emerged as one of the principal narrative modes of our time, but putting words and pictures together is as old as writing itself. In this course, you will read contemporary graphic fiction and nonfiction alongside essays by scholars, creators, and critics that explore the interplay of visual and textual elements in graphic storytelling. You will also study the theory surrounding how comics — the contemporary term for graphic fiction and nonfiction — are created and understood. You’ll read at least one novel alongside its graphic adaptation, examining what’s gained — and what’s lost — in the transition between these narrative forms. You will explore how comics convey meaning and develop an understanding of the “grammar” involved in reading a panel, page, and sequence. You will examine the complex relationship between comics and conventional fiction and how comics relate to other forms of visual art and sequential narrative. You will write several critical essays and personal narratives and produce a substantial graphic narrative, with an in-depth analysis of your aesthetic choices, as your final product for the course.",Option to earn advanced (500-level) credit.,"Prerequisite: ENG 311, ENG 311LM, or equivalent."
ENG472.1,English Seminar: Reading and Writing Poetry,Fall,Bev 233,"Open to juniors, seniors, and PGs.
Emily Dickinson wrote, “If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can warm me, I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.” In this course, you will chase that sensorial experience, in the hopes of emerging at the end of the semester knowing poetry with the whole of your being. This course will be a deep dive into both the reading and writing of poetry. You will study poetry that spans countries, centuries, and modalities. You will spend the semester unpacking the what and how of this literary genre, asking of each poem you encounter “what does it do?” and “how does it do it?” to better understand poetry as a unique form and to capture its unique essence in our own writing. You will begin the semester by demystifying this genre, unpacking preconceived notions about poetry. You will then transition into close reading and analysis, and you will write both critically and creatively in response to the poetry you study. Finally, you will finish the semester by preparing a portfolio of your own work. This is a course for artists and thinkers alike. You should expect to undertake a rigorous reading and response schedule, as well as look forward to the opportunity to hone your own voice on the page.",Option to earn advanced (500-level) credit.,"Prerequisite: ENG 311, ENG 311LM, or equivalent."
ENG474.1,English Seminar: The Pleasures of Difficulty,Spring,,"Do you want to challenge your mind with concepts that defy the typical, with texts that force you to slow down and puzzle through tangled thoughts? In this course, you will read, write about, and discuss texts from across genres –– fiction, nonfiction, poetry — that are, well,  difficult. That is to say, these are texts (and ways of reading them) that leave some work for you as a reader to do. This course is designed to teach you new ways to read, write, and think and to become more aware of yourself as a reader, writer, and thinker. What makes a text “difficult”? Why embrace difficulty? What reading and thinking strategies allow us to work with difficult texts? How does the process of overcoming difficulty contribute to our experience of literature? Here you will welcome difficulty as an expected guest in the learning process. You will work together to engage with complexity, observe closely, question skillfully, become aware of assumptions, adjust your expectations, and discover new things. Perhaps most important, since difficulty is a part of life and an essential part of the processes of intellectual growth and of creativity, the work you do in this course will allow you to discover the pleasures of difficulty. You will learn to rely on discussion and informal, exploratory writing as tools for thinking. Written work will include regular “difficulty papers” as well as critical and creative pieces. You will come away from this course with the skills and confidence to tackle anything you might want or need to read in the future –– and ready to take on all kinds of difficulty. Possible course texts include George Steiner’s “On Difficulty,” Gertrude Stein’s “Tender Buttons,” Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse,” Gabriel García Márquez’s “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” Italo Calvino’s “If on a winter’s night a traveler,” William Faulkner’s “The Sound and the Fury,” and Rebecca Solnit’s “Men Explain Things to Me.”",Option to earn advanced (500-level) credit.,"Prerequisite: ENG 311, ENG 311LM, or equivalent.
